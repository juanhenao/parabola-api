# Parabola


## About Parabola

Parabola is a php project developed with the Laravel framework and Bootstrap. The name comes from the latin term for word. Its purpose is to help with vocabulary when learning a new language as I believe in the importance of understanding each other.

It is intented to grow step by step as its a side project which I develop in my free time.

## Live Instance

If you want to take a look at how the project looks like in its master branch, a live instance of the project can be found running on Azure at [https://parabola.azurewebsites.net/](https://parabola.azurewebsites.net/login). Please take into consideration that this is only a demo with really small ressources, so it can be really slow, and definitely not for production.
